I am a PhD student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) in the [Systems Software & Security Lab](https://gts3.org/) advised by [Taesoo Kim](https://taesoo.kim/). My research interests are systems security and, in particular, mobile security and binary analysis. I have worked on ARM TrustZone security and native code of Android applications. If you are interested, send me an email, and I am happy to talk!

Before I started the PhD, I did a Master's at [FAU](https://www.fau.eu/) and an internship at the [UCSB SecLab](https://seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/).

## Personal Projects

### Magic Mirror

In 2019 I did a hardware project inspired by Dylan Pierce's [MirrorMirror](https://metro.co.uk/2015/12/30/tech-genius-builds-magic-mirror-for-girlfriend-which-compliments-her-and-gives-weather-updates-5591422/). I built the frame with my dad and wrote a simple flask app for the interface. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/fab1ano/magic-mirror).

### Capture-The-Flag

If I find time, I play Capture-The-Flags (CTFs). Some write-ups are available on my GitHub page (i.e., [Tasteless CTF 2020](https://github.com/fab1ano/tasteless-ctf-20), [hxp CTF 2020](https://github.com/fab1ano/hxp-ctf-20), [Google CTF 2020](https://github.com/fab1ano/google-ctf-20), [Da Vinci CTF 2021](https://github.com/fab1ano/davinci-ctf-21)).

Also, I was a challenge author and organizer of the FAUST CTF (CTFTime ranking 100/100 in 2021).
With FAUST, I also qualified for the RuCTF Finals 2019 in Yekaterinburg, and we [ranked first](https://www.cs1.tf.fau.de/2020/11/20/fau-security-team-faust-ranks-first-in-cyber-security-rumble-germany/) in the Cyber Security Rumble Germany 2020 (second in the international ranking).

### High-Performance Computing

Before I focused on system security, I worked on high-performance computing. I participated in the Student Cluster Competition of the International Supercomputing Conference (ISC17) in 2017 with a [team of fellow students](https://www.gauss-centre.eu/news/newsflashes/article/gcs-sponsors-team-from-fau-to-compete-in-isc17-student-cluster-competition/) from my local university. We <u>ranked first</u> in the category of the [highest LINPACK](http://www.hpcadvisorycouncil.com/events/2017/isc17-student-cluster-competition/) and received the *Highest LINPACK Performance Award*.

## PhD & Writing Resources

Recently, I started collecting resources that I found (and find) helpful for academic writing and on how to approach a PhD program. I listed them below, mainly as a reference for myself. Maybe you find some of them helpful as well.

* Ronald T. Azuma's ["So long, and thanks for the Ph.D.!"](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~azuma/hitch4.html): An extensive guide on whether to do a PhD and what to do after the PhD
* ["Graduate School Survival Guide"](https://www.math.waikato.ac.nz/~seano/grad-school-advice.html) by Wanda Pratt: Bullet points on advising, reading, and how to succeed in your research
* ["Writing Technical Articles"](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/etc/writing-style.html) and ["Common Bugs in Writing"](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/etc/writing-bugs.html) by Henning Schulzrinne: Tipps on the paper structure and a collection of technical details in academic writing
* Gernot Heiser's ["Tips and Guidance for Students Writing Papers and Reports"](http://gernot-heiser.org/style-guide.html): A guide on academic writing, including a collection of common pitfalls
